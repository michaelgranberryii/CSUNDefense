## CSU, Northridge Defense

### Why Are We Doing This?
The main purpose of this organization is to provide experience and exposure to CSU Northridge students who are interested in working for the Aerospace and Defense industry.

### What Are We Trying to Achieve?
Our goal for this organization is to create senior design based research within four sectors of Defense: Air, Maritime, Ground, and Space forces. 
Within the four sectors, CSUN Defense hopes to design and build autonamous drones and robots to provide defensive mechanisms from potential threat. 

### Sub Teams:
To make this project as fluid as possible, we will create Sub Teams:
* Design / Mechanical / Electrical
* Systems
* Communications

#### Design / Mechanical / Electrical
The priority of this Sub Team is to research, design, build the chassis of our MataDrone. Research required materials and items needed for our project.
#### Systems
The priority of this Sub Team is to research and understand machine learning, image recognition, and programming of the Maneuvering System.
#### Communcation / Cybersecurity
The priority of this Sub Team is to research about antenna design and how to build filters to prevent interruptions. An example would be to research how notch filters work in real life scenario, how to create a spoofing devices, or how to spoof GPS signal.

### Our First Project:
#### Summer 2022 / MataDrone

#### Project Shield:
Our summer project is MataDrone, a defense drone with the sole purpose of achieving surveillance and threat detection from ground to air spaces.
MataDroneâ€™s role in defense is vital to the safety of our students, community, and military personnel from potential threats.
